Problem Identification :

         Many astronauts suffer from psychological problems, such as depression and loneliness while they are in space. This is because many people are isolated from their loved ones and cannot talk to them in space.  Some people also suffer from mental issues after they get back home.  There have even been cases when the astronauts came back and tried to (some were successful) kill themselves. We are trying to prevent these problems by providing a technical solution to counter their loneliness when they are in space.
         
Solution:

     The solution is an app that can do many things that help astronauts from facing psychological problems in space. This is so that astronauts don’t feel like they are out of contact with their families and when they are in space, they will not feel lonely and depressed

The solution that:
1) Becomes part of the astronaut's day
2) Keeps them healthy
3) Bring them closer to their family on earth
4) Track their Vitals and Nutritional intake

Design:

1) Built on mern stack and all my front end components and routing are all done in react.
2) Every page is a separate component and used react router to route traffic between components.
3) React bootstrap for front end and I also used MDB library to include Modal/Carousel.
4) I built APIs/Routes in node[add workout,load workout,get wearable data] which in turn connects to mongodb/external APIs’ where it        stores data and retrieves data from.
























This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
